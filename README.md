## The Branching Strategies that can be used in each of the projects

-Main Branch
The project's stable and production-ready version is reflected in the main branch, which is also known as the mainline branch. On this branch, no additions to development must be made directly.

-Feature Branches 
Build a distinct feature branch branching out from development for every new feature or major improvement. Give the branch a name that is describing, such feature/authentication or feature/payment. In this branch, individually construct the feature.

-Bug Fix Branches
Make bug fix branches that split from development to solve particular problems. These branches may be titled bugfix/issue-123 or bugfix/missing-data, for example. Solve the problem in this branch.


## The Explainaton on the use of a gitingnore file with each project.

A crucial component of version control in Git repositories is a.gitignore file. It enables you to select which folders and documents are not to be included in version tracking, preventing sensitive or pointless files from being added to the repository. This is especially helpful for preserving a tidy and structured project structure and for avoiding the unintentional disclosure of sensitive information.


## Below in the ReadMe file explains the storage of credentials and sensitive information

-Encryption
Use industry-standard encryption libraries and techniques if encryption is required. Avoid "putting up" your own encryption solutions, as they are frequently more vulnerable.

-Avoid Hardcoding
Hardcoding can result in unintended disclosure, particularly while sharing code or utilizing version control systems. Never hardcode credentials or sensitive information directly into the source.
